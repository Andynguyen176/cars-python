# Car's Project 

Hello!

You might be wondering what this repository is all about. This is the very first project, I created in my introduction to programming which introduced me to the power of Python, SQL, and HTML. I was required to make a website from scratch involving pulling data from SQL and display the results with Python and HTML. This project didn't look like the best for a front-end but it means a lot to me. This is what fueled my passion for technology and data. 

Thank you, Professor Nehoran for giving us students the opportunity to learn python and drift away from Microsoft Visual Basics @ SJSU. I'm grateful for that.
